This is because we will use it once last time to make all the samples we gather the same length by applying padding, which requires knowing the model's preferences regarding padding (to the left or right? with which token?). The `tokenizer` has a pad method that will do all of this right for us, and the `Trainer` will use it. You can customize this part by defining and passing your own `data_collator` which will receive the samples like the dictionaries seen above and will need to return a dictionary of tensors."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CdzABDVcIrJg"},"source":["We can now fine-tune our model by just calling the `train` method for the CoLA dataset:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"uNx5pyRlIrJh","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":247},"outputId":"9ecb62ad-2ce1-45f0-b932-cee8b0b19922"},"source":["trainer.train()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","    <div>\n","      \n","      <progress value='2675' max='2675' style='width:300px; height:20px; vertical-align: middle;'></progress>\n","      [2675/2675 06:46, Epoch 5/5]\n","    </div>\n","    <table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","      <th>Epoch</th>\n","      <th>Training Loss</th>\n","      <th>Validation Loss</th>\n","      <th>Matthews Correlation</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0.583200</td>\n","      <td>0.530612</td>\n","      <td>0.367276</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0.488900</td>\n","      <td>0.485126</td>\n","      <td>0.460998</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>0.464300</td>\n","      <td>0.493656</td>\n","      <td>0.469197</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>0.445400</td>\n","      <td>0.478455</td>\n","      <td>0.496613</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>0.443400</td>\n","      <td>0.489801</td>\n","      <td>0.474714</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table><p>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["TrainOutput(global_step=2675, training_loss=0.4819134407399971, metrics={'train_runtime': 407.0419, 'train_samples_per_second': 6.572, 'total_flos': 0, 'epoch': 5.0})"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":24}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CKASz-2vIrJi"},"source":["We can check with the `evaluate` method that our `Trainer` did reload the best model properly (if it wasn't the last one):"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UOUcBkX8IrJi","pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":126},"outputId":"20d54007-10a0-4dad-b758-be58fe74c17e"},"source":["trainer.evaluate()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","    <div>\n","      \n","      <progress value='66' max='66' style='width:300px; height:20px; vertical-align: middle;'></progress>\n","      [66/66 00:03]\n","    </div>\n","    "]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'eval_loss': 0.4784548282623291,\n"," 'eval_matthews_correlation': 0.4966130731383176,\n"," 'eval_runtime': 3.7013,\n"," 'eval_samples_per_second': 281.792,\n"," 'epoch': 5.0}"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":25}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"},"id":"TFkq0YY0PUkq"},"source":["> The pretrained BERT + Adapters model reached a reasonable performance after just $4$ epochs.
